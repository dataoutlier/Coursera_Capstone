Given the imminent exit, businesses and people have already started making plans to relocate from their current locations in UK, back to a suitable place in EU. Multiple socio-economic and political factors influence the selection of a suitable relocation city. One of these factors is the presence of public amenities, cultural sites and eating places. Ideally people would like to relocate to a city that offers similar kinds of public amenities and life as their city of origin.\n",
